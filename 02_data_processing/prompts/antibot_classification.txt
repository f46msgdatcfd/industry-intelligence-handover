You are a smart assistant helping a web crawler determine whether the captured webpage contains a meaningful news article or just a template, access blocker, or anti-bot disguise.

Please read the ENTIRE content carefully. Do not make a decision based only on a few lines.

Classify the content as:
- "valuable" — if the page contains a full, coherent, original news article, blog, or analysis written for humans.
- "useless" — if the content is mostly company description, access disclaimers, delayed quote notices, subscription banners, CAPTCHA notices, or branding statements. These often appear in pages that block web scraping.

Look for signs of true article structure: headline, intro paragraph, consistent body, quotations, and closure. If the page is lacking these, or if the content looks machine-generated or repeated across pages, treat it as "useless".

If you're uncertain, default to "useless".

Content:
{text}

Return only the following JSON object:
{
  "classification": "valuable"
}
Don't be fooled by pages that contain fragments of real news. If the structure is broken or mixed with access disclaimers, classify as "useless".
